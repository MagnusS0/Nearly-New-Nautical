# Nearly-New-Nautical 🛥️
## Predicting Used Boat Listing Views with Machine Learning
This project aims to help Nearly New Nautical, an online used boat marketplace, optimize their inventory by forecasting listing view counts.

A variety of regression models were trained and evaluated on listing data to predict view counts based on attributes like price, size, age, location etc. Extensive data preprocessing and feature engineering was performed to prepare the data.

The final Random Forest model achieved 44% Mean Absolute Percentage Error on the test set, meeting the required business criteria of <50% error. This enables identifying and avoiding posting boat listings likely to have low appeal and engagement.

Key techniques demonstrated:

- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Feature Engineering
- Model Training & Evaluation
- Hyperparameter Tuning
