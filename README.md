# Nearly-New-Nautical
## Predicting Used Boat Listing Views with Machine Learning
This project aims to help Nearly New Nautical, an online used boat marketplace, optimize their inventory by forecasting listing view counts.

A variety of regression models were developed and evaluated on listing data to predict view counts based on attributes like price, size, age, location etc. Extensive data preprocessing and feature engineering was performed to prepare the data.

The final Random Forest model predicted view counts within  44% mean absolute precentage error (MAPE), meeting the required business criteria (50%). This enables identifying and avoiding posting boat listings likely to have low appeal and engagement.

Key skills demonstrated include:

- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Feature Engineering
- Model Development & Evaluation
- Hyperparameter Tuning

The notbook includes the code used with comments. The data set I got from DataCamp, follow this link to see the notebook there as well.
